KidzMash Sessionz
What about other KidzMash sessions? Do I need a ticket?  No! You simply need to register as a KidzMash attendee! The regular Sessionz held in Mangrove are on a first come first serve basis and this year are limited to 50 attendees plus guardian. We recommend showing up early if you plan on attending any KidzMash session.

 

KidzMash Makerz
This space is dedicated to getting hands-on by performing and completing experiments and projects designed for parents and kidz of all ages to enjoy together!

We are not going to tell you all of them, but some of the fun includes:

Spintronics
Snap Circuits
Ozobots
Tear Apart Lab
and more!
As always, all minors must be accompanied by an adult at CodeMash. Each project is designed to be self-managed by parents and kidz so you can explore and create on your own.
