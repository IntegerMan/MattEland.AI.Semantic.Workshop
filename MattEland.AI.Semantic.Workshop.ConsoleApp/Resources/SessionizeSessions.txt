                "description": "Are you a budding super hero or super villain* but you feel like you're lacking that AI companion to help you reach that next level? Have you ever wanted to see what AI can do to help your daily life? Do you have an interesting application that would just be so much better with a little artificial intelligence? Don't fear, because of course there's a PreCompiler for that.\r\n\r\nIn this half-day workshop we'll see how to build enterprise-level AI applications by integrating AI vision, speech, and large language models into an app. We'll start out simple by seeing how to work with these APIs on their own before layering them together with Semantic Kernel to form an AI system capable of planning complex tasks involving external data and APIs.\r\n\r\nBy the time we're done, you'll have a better understanding of what AI can do and see how easy it is to integrate it into your applications. You'll also be that much closer to super hero / super villain* status with a modular personal AI companion of your very own to continue extending after CodeMash is over.\r\n\r\n* CodeMash does not endorse acts of villainy including but not limited to taking over the world and/or the Kalahari.",

                "description": "TLDR: Architects get relatively few opportunities to practice their craft, so we will group up to formulate architectural visions for \"real world\" business problems. Attendees will then evaluate each group's solution to gain insight into the pros and cons of different approaches.\r\n\r\nFred Brooks said, \"How do we get great designers? Great designers design, of course.\" So how do we get great architects? Great architects architect, but architecting a software system is a rare opportunity for the non-architect. For this, we turn to an ancient tradition, born of the martial arts, designed to give the student the opportunity to practice more than basics in a semi-realistic way. The coding kata, created by Dave Thomas, is an opportunity for the developer to try a language or tool to solve a problem slightly more complex than \"Hello world\". The architectural kata, like the coding kata, is an opportunity for the student-architect to practice architecting a software system.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees will be split into small groups and given a \"real world\" business problem (the kata). Attendees will be expected to formulate an architectural vision for the project, asking questions (of the instructor) as necessary to better understand the requirements, then defend questions (posed by both the instructor and their fellow attendees) about their choice in technology and approach, and then evaluate others' efforts in a similar fashion. No equipment is necessary to participate--the great architect has no need of tools, just their mind and the customers' participation and feedback.",

When you and your team understand where your geniuses are and how to (and when not to) use them, it can improve meetings, reduce burnout, and dramatically reduce turbulence in getting projects done. In this workshop we will review the 6 types of working geniuses and how they bring projects from ideation to implementation. We will discover the hidden cause of burnout and how to keep meetings, including our agile ceremonies, more focused and more productive as a whole, all with the goal of improving your life and team culture, both in and outside of work. (that's right… ALL projects!)\r\n\r\nThis workshop will allow everyone to take the assessment at no cost. We will create teams and go over mock scenarios and go into depth on how this affects teamwork and dramatically reduce turbulent culture. ",

In this workshop, attendees will form teams and attempt to build a LEGO(R) set without instructions. Through a series of iterative exercises that provide more product details, the teams will attempt to build & test their product as close to the instructions as possible without peeking.\r\n\r\nEach group will learn different approaches to collaborate on product development and testing during the meeting to build a set according to a customer's needs. The workshop will highlight the gap between what we set out to build & the finished product as well as the gap between what our customers expect & the finished product. Our goal as a group will be to refine our techniques so we deliver a product on-time & on-budget that customers will love.",

                "description": "This second session is a follow up where we get to make 3D models! Children must have a responsible adult present. We will work with a fully featured CAD application called Rhino3d and walk through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions. This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary-level geometry, and basic computer skills. The session is probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on the child's capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be to create up to two basic things- a cup, and a keychain.\r\nLess confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up with parents or siblings and just watch the parent/sibling. Kids that complete the kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walk-through lab as they will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: We have a fairly large number of printers in the lab so our kids can possibly print items they make in class. If your child completes a model, we will be able to produce a screen render if desired or we will make our best efforts to print at least one model per student, based on demand.",

We'll also discuss problems in these tools and techniques malware authors use to avoid analysis. \r\n\r\nAfterward, we'll really get our feet wet with Ghidra.  We'll look into reversing some C binaries, C++, and Go.\r\n\r\nIf time allows, we'll look into more complicated examples of malware analysis and level up skills all around.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of C# and x86 assembly is helpful but not required!

                "description": "TLDR: Architects get relatively few opportunities to practice their craft, so we will group up to formulate architectural visions for \"real world\" business problems. Attendees will then evaluate each group's solution to gain insight into the pros and cons of different approaches.\r\n\r\nFred Brooks said, \"How do we get great designers? Great designers design, of course.\" So how do we get great architects? Great architects architect, but architecting a software system is a rare opportunity for the non-architect. For this, we turn to an ancient tradition, born of the martial arts, designed to give the student the opportunity to practice more than basics in a semi-realistic way. The coding kata, created by Dave Thomas, is an opportunity for the developer to try a language or tool to solve a problem slightly more complex than \"Hello world\". The architectural kata, like the coding kata, is an opportunity for the student-architect to practice architecting a software system.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees will be split into small groups and given a \"real world\" business problem (the kata). Attendees will be expected to formulate an architectural vision for the project, asking questions (of the instructor) as necessary to better understand the requirements, then defend questions (posed by both the instructor and their fellow attendees) about their choice in technology and approach, and then evaluate others' efforts in a similar fashion. No equipment is necessary to participate--the great architect has no need of tools, just their mind and the customers' participation and feedback.",

We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them. If you have heard of the exciting world of CAD and 3D printing but have never tried it or would like a basic overview, this session is for you!",

                "description": "Want to make something more advanced than the ones you made in the basic overview? We have some additional options to expand model building skills for those who have been through our previous sessions. \r\n\r\nNEW for this year we are offering a deeper dive into the process of making jewelry with CAD and 3D printing. We will go over a brief presentation about various ways of making jewelry from CAD models and then we will transition into a more advanced Rhino model-building walk-through session to build a pendant that would work for casting. These models can be printed out on our resin printers. \r\n\r\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D. \r\n\r\nThis session will run on Tuesday, after the adult session from 4-6pm.  After we get some of the models printed, we plan to offer a tech demo of the process of using Delft Clay to take an impression from the 3D models. This will likely occur on Wednesday evening at around 8PM.  \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend.",

We frequently hear about the power of AI-enabled tools, and are shown soundbytes of experts extolling the virtues of their approach.\r\n\r\nWhile these stories inform and entertain, they also create the perception that AI i s extremely difficult and exclusively the realm of experts, which simply isn’t true! These days we do not need to be an AI expert to reap the benefits of the research community. Off-the-shelf open source tools exist which are powerful enough to solve many industrial problems. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will map business problems to tools and show how to translate a problem domain into the expected input of the tool. Using these tools will help us identify development opportunities that we might have otherwise missed and save time by not re-implementing common solving techniques.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is split between lecture portions, where we talk about common problems, formalisms, and historical applications and hands on sections where we work through demos and exercises of open source tools solving the kinds of problems we just discussed.  \r\n\r\nWe’ll cover the following broad topics and tools:\r\n\r\nThree major types of AI problems:\r\n* Processing Natural Language\r\n* Making Sense of Data\r\n* Building Controllers for Automated Systems (e.g. Robots)\r\n\r\nSeveral off-the-shelf tools that can tackle these problems:\r\n* ChatGPT\r\n* VADER Sentiment Analysis\r\n* scikit-learn\r\n* PyTorch\r\n* Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym)\r\n",

                "description": "React has great tools for Unit Testing component. This doesn’t mean testing is easy. There are still a lot of questions you have to figure out for yourself: How many component tests should you write vs end-to-end tests or lower-level unit tests? How can you test a certain line of code that is tricky to test? And what in the world are you supposed to do about that persistent act() warning?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we’ll introduce Unit Testing with React, along with a mental model for how to think about designing your components and tests. This mental model will help you see how to test each bit of logic, whether or not to mock dependencies, and will help improve the design of your components. You’ll walk away with the tools, techniques, and principles you need to implement low-cost, high-value component tests.\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\n\r\n- The different kinds of React application tests, and where component tests fit in.\r\n- A mental model for thinking about the inputs and outputs of the components you test.\r\n- Options for selecting DOM elements to verify and interact with them.\r\n- The value of mocks and why they shouldn’t be avoided.\r\n- The challenges with asynchrony in RTL tests and how to handle them.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n\r\n- Familiarity with building applications with React.\r\n- Basic experience writing automated tests with Jest or another unit testing framework.",

But software developers, data engineers, cloud engineers, and so many other disciplines often have no idea how to work effectively within those operating systems.

And how do you get things working again?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, you'll be dropped head-first into a broken deployment machine, and you'll need to fix it, fast! This will be a fun & lightly-competitive experience for all involved. Teams/individuals will be scored automatically based on how well (and how quickly) they are able to restore their machine to its former glory.",

                "description": "This second session is a follow up where we get to make 3D models! Children must have a responsible adult present. We will work with a fully featured CAD application called Rhino3d and walk through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions. This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary-level geometry, and basic computer skills. The session is probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on the child's capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be to create up to two basic things- a cup, and a keychain.\r\nLess confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up with parents or siblings and just watch the parent/sibling. Kids that complete the kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walk-through lab as they will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: We have a fairly large number of printers in the lab so our kids can possibly print items they make in class. If your child completes a model, we will be able to produce a screen render if desired or we will make our best efforts to print at least one model per student, based on demand.",

                "description": "Hearing about artificial intelligence is unavoidable these days if you’re watching the news or staying abreast of the technical sector. We frequently hear about the power of AI-enabled tools, and are shown soundbytes of experts extolling the virtues of their approach.\r\n\r\nWhile these stories inform and entertain, they also create the perception that AI i s extremely difficult and exclusively the realm of experts, which simply isn’t true! These days we do not need to be an AI expert to reap the benefits of the research community. Off-the-shelf open source tools exist which are powerful enough to solve many industrial problems. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will map business problems to tools and show how to translate a problem domain into the expected input of the tool. Using these tools will help us identify development opportunities that we might have otherwise missed and save time by not re-implementing common solving techniques.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is split between lecture portions, where we talk about common problems, formalisms, and historical applications and hands on sections where we work through demos and exercises of open source tools solving the kinds of problems we just discussed.  \r\n\r\nWe’ll cover the following broad topics and tools:\r\n\r\nThree major types of AI problems:\r\n* Processing Natural Language\r\n* Making Sense of Data\r\n* Building Controllers for Automated Systems (e.g. Robots)\r\n\r\nSeveral off-the-shelf tools that can tackle these problems:\r\n* ChatGPT\r\n* VADER Sentiment Analysis\r\n* scikit-learn\r\n* PyTorch\r\n* Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym)\r\n",

As architects though, we must consider the trade offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone finds on the inner webs?\r\n\r\nAs architects it is our responsibility to effectively guide our teams on the technology journey. In this talk I will outline the importance of trade offs, how we can analyze new technologies and how we can effectively capture the inevitable architectural decisions we will make. I will also explore the value of fitness functions as a way of ensuring the decisions we make are actually reflected in the code base.",

                "description": "If you’re like a lot of developers, you’ve probably used Redis. You’ve probably used it as a cache—which it does amazingly—and you’ve probably cached strings. But Redis is much, much more than just a cache. It can be a message broker using queues, streams, and pub-sub. It can be a multi-model, in-memory, NoSQL database storing all sorts of data structures like hashes, lists, sets, and binary data. It can even be extended using modules to add new commands, new data structures, and new capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, I’ll show you how to take full advantage of all that Redis can do from your Node.js applications—starting from the very beginning with a primer on Redis. We’ll cover the basics—talking to Redis from the command line and exploring its capabilities. Then, we’ll take advantage of those capabilities from Node.js, building some simple yet surprising powerful applications using the low-level Node.js client—Node Redis.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we’ll look at ways to extend Redis with modules, with an emphasis on using RediSearch to find the data and RedisJSON to store documents.\r\n\r\nRedis does a lot more than you probably thought. The whole point of this workshop is to show you that “more” and give you the knowledge to take greater advantage of the Redis you are already using. So, let’s start learning and start using!",

We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them. If you have heard of the exciting world of CAD and 3D printing but have never tried it or would like a basic overview, this session is for you!",

The idea behind this is to have this be a standalone class, but also a fallback for \"the rule of feet\".\r\n\r\nWant to get started in electronics but don’t know where to get started? You’ll be shocked how easy it is! Get hands on experience building a few simple circuits and start yer Maker’in!\r\n\r\nKids 10+ welcome with adult supervision. The advanced section will cover using Arduino microcontrollers so install Pre-requisites on your laptop for the last section.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites: Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)\r\n\r\nAdditional notes\r\nKit required. Please see eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codemash-2023-tickets-396878312717) for tickets.

We have some additional options to expand model building skills for those who have been through our previous sessions. \r\n\r\nThis session the goal will be to build a raceable “matchbox/hot wheels scaled” 3d-printed race car. We will be using a variety of model techniques to produce a model car that resembles a real race car and then print it out on the lab’s advanced resin printers. While this session will repeat, the idea will be that attendees are welcome to come to both race league sessions and make different cars or continue working on tuning the model into a super car! \r\n\r\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D. \r\n \r\nThis session will run Wednesday and Thursday, after the adult session - 4-6pm.\r\n\r\nWe will have some track pieces at the lab to test and possibly race the cars once we get them built!  \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend. \r\n",

From what I've seen it's not something that colleges or courses have nearly enough emphasis on for the impact that it has. Both on your skills, and the health of the systems you work in.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about learning what it means to build software that supports having both unit and integration tests. This session will cover some key principles that are required in order to build testable code, and touch on more advanced design patterns that build on these principles. It will also make the case for why investing the time in this test automation is so worthwhile, even if it does mean more time spent by engineers up front.",

It's a deceitful design scheme we all encounter from time to time, against our will. \r\n\r\nAs consumers, most of us can't escape the overbearing influence that corporations have on our lives. This is particularly true when it comes to how companies use various experience design tricks, traps and persuasive tactics in their software & technology in order to take advantage of customers and coerce them into doing things like spending more money than intended.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn about the unethical psychology behind these dark design patterns that digital organizations covertly deploy in order to manipulate their users. You may even discover that some of your favorite apps are using these shady techniques on you without you even knowing it. \r\n\r\nYou'll also walk away with the skills to ensure that your team does not fall prey to such ploys, including negotiation with challenging stakeholders, so y'all can build better products together that positively impact customers' lives.",

ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are often pigeonholed as challenges. However, what if we told you that these so-called 'disorders' house superpowers that can be game-changers in the realm of coding and software development?\r\n\r\nJoin us as we delve into the remarkable abilities often associated with ADHD and ASD - like laser-sharp focus, unparalleled attention to minutiae, and a natural flair for discerning patterns. More than just a session, this is a call to action: to shift our industry paradigm from focusing on perceived deficits to recognizing and leveraging these neurodiverse strengths.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, attendees will:\r\n- Gain insights into how traits associated with ADHD and ASD can be massive assets in the tech and coding environment.\r\n- Learn strategies to nurture and harness these neurodiverse strengths, creating a more inclusive and effective workplace.\r\n- Challenge and reshape their perceptions about neurodiversity, emphasizing a strengths-first approach.",

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that foundations like the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF), OpenSSF, CNCF and OWASP are working to solve.. To help ensure a secure SDLC, these vendor neutral, developer focused communities are investing in projects that provide security solutions. This talk will highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and how technologists all around the globe are working to solve this problem.",

                "description": "Documentation should be complete and comprehensive, but that doesn't mean it has to be dull and boring. Engaging documentation focuses on what your users want to do, the tasks they're trying to accomplish, the problems they want to solve. Writing documentation with the focus on your user, instead of the product, results in a better experience for the user and a better reputation for your product. \r\n\r\nFinding the right balance isn't always easy, though. In this session, you'll discover the right verbs that fit the use cases for your product. That means learning more about your users and what they want, which may be more than one group of people. You'll turn those use cases into effective tutorials that cover the right amount of information. And you'll learn when reference-style documentation is needed, and how to make that more efficient too.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn:\r\n* How to shift the focus from what the product is to what the reader wants to do.\r\n* Discovering the verbs that relate to your product.\r\n* How to create tutorial scenarios for your use cases.\r\n* How to write effective documentation for users with different experience levels.\r\n* When reference-style documentation is appropriate.",

                "description": "Language models have made significant advancements in recent years, with models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 showcasing impressive capabilities. However, one persistent challenge that arises with these models is the occurrence of hallucinations—instances where the model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical responses. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore strategies to ground language models to minimize the occurrence of hallucinations. By grounding LLMs, we aim to enhance their reliability and ensure that the generated outputs align more closely with factual accuracy and logical coherence.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss various techniques and approaches that can be employed to address hallucinations effectively. These may include fine-tuning the models on domain-specific data, incorporating external knowledge sources, leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback, and implementing robust evaluation mechanisms. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will delve into the underlying causes of hallucinations and examine the limitations of current language models. By understanding these factors, we can develop targeted strategies to mitigate the occurrence of hallucinations and improve the overall performance of LLMs.\r\n\r\nJoin us in this talk as we explore practical methods to ground language models and minimize hallucinations. Discover how these techniques can enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, making them more suitable for real-world applications across various domains. Together, let's unlock the full potential of language models while ensuring their outputs align with factual accuracy and logical coherence.",

Anti-patterns are traps that developers encounter frequently due to lack of time, carelessness, inexperience, or pressure from project managers. Rushing can lead to big problems for applications in future, so you need to know how to avoid potential errors.\r\n\r\nCome learn about Java Anti-Patterns. In this session beginner Java developers can learn to identify common rookie developer mistakes. Experienced developers can cry or laugh together as we look at real-life examples of Java code. You will leave this session knowing how to avoid these anti-patterns and write elegant, maintainable, and (dare we say it?) fun to work with code. Finally, you will find better ways to implement solutions using Java.",

                "description": "In today's rapidly evolving software landscape, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are the linchpins of a streamlined and efficient development process. However, with myriad build platforms, technologies, and tooling, we often find ourselves entangled in complex build pipelines that require platform-specific tasks and scripts. Is there a way to untangle this web and create build processes that are not only reproducible but also portable across different environments? The answer lies in leveraging the extensibility of MSBuild.\r\n\r\nJoin us in this immersive session, where we delve into the powerful capabilities of MSBuild, the heart of .NET build. You will learn how to extend MSBuild with custom tasks and targets to replace complex PowerShell and Bash scripts or platform specific steps on GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines. The session aims to empower you with the skills needed to:\r\n\r\nUnderstand the core concepts of MSBuild Tasks and Targets.\r\nExtend MSBuild to perform specialized tasks during your build process.\r\nCreate build configurations that are both reproducible and platform-agnostic.\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll walk away with a toolkit for designing cleaner, simpler, and more efficient CI/CD pipelines that can run identically, whether you're building on a developer's machine or a hosted build agent.\r\n\r\nDitch those complex scripts and build steps, and come explore how MSBuild can simplify your build processes and make your CI/CD more robust and maintainable.",

                "description": "One of the greatest strengths of modern development is the ease of unit testing for many languages and frameworks. Obviously, you’re testing your code–but are you thoroughly testing it? Are you testing the right things? Is there more you could be testing?\r\n\r\nEnter black box testing techniques. Equivalence partitioning. Boundary value analysis. Decision tables. Combinatorial testing. State transition testing. While black box is done without considering the code, these are the foundational testing techniques and can be applied to any type of testing. You’ll learn about each type of testing and how to apply it to different situations to understand the features better and engage in deeper testing.\r\n\r\nJoin me as we walk through these five foundational techniques and how we can apply them to our unit tests. You’ll come away from the talk with a stronger understanding of testing and how to go beyond ‘Does it work’ into ‘Does it work well?’",

                "description": "For the past few years, Flutter has revolutionized mobile app development by allowing developers to build high-performance, cross-platform applications with ease. However, building a full-stack application can be a challenging task because we often find ourselves juggling multiple technologies to solve problems across an application stack.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how to build a full-stack application using Flutter and Dart Frog. \r\n\r\nDart Frog is a backend framework that, when coupled with Flutter, allows developers to build full-stack applications using a single programming language. By leveraging the power of Flutter for the front-end and Dart Frog for the backend, developers can build high-performance applications with ease.\r\n\r\nWe will start by introducing the basics of Flutter and Dart Frog and their key features. We will then dive into building a full-stack application, starting with the front-end using Flutter, and then moving onto the backend using Dart Frog. We will cover topics such as handling user authentication, building RESTful APIs, and using a database to store data.\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, we will also discuss best practices for building full-stack applications and how to ensure that your application is scalable and maintainable. We will also highlight the advantages of using Flutter and Dart Frog together, including reduced development time and increased developer productivity.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of how to build a full-stack application using Flutter and Dart Frog. They will also have learned best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications, as well as the benefits of using Flutter and Dart Frog together.",

                "description": "ChatGPT has been in the center stage since early this year. We will first take a look into this exciting sub-new field of Generative AI, and understand what LLM and NLP are, and the challenges that all of these are presenting themselves. We will also highlight the importance of Vector Search, and what a Vector DB's role is helping with the embeddings and fast index pattern matches/searches. While it is exciting, we also need to ensure that the process of building, integrating, and continuous deployment are being handled in the most efficient way, and by leveraging the cloud native environment with Kubernetes, we will examine how the process can be optimized by leveraging on the serverless and event-driven nature of a typical cloud native environment.\r\n\r\nMLOps—machine learning operations, or DevOps for machine learning—is the intersection of people, process, and platform for gaining business value from machine learning. It streamlines development and deployment via monitoring, validation, and governance of machine learning models. With the rapid rise in popularity in GenAI, we will explore how the operational side of things will be impacted and what MLOps will differ from DevOps.",

Despite quirks and \"hallucinations\", LLMs show real promise of being a valuable component in the future of thinking machines.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for a few years, voice technologies such as Amazon Alexa have enabled applications that talk and listen to users, creating a natural and lifelike user interface. The pairing of Alexa and LLMs seems all to obvious: A thinking machine that can converse with its users.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll explore ways to bring LLMs to life with voice. We'll consider a handful of popular LLMs and see how to integrate them into a voice user experience offered by Alexa. You'll leave with a basic understanding of where the integration points are and hopefully be inspired to create amazing and unique user experiences.",

                "description": "This second session is a follow up where we get to make 3D models! Children must have a responsible adult present. We will work with a fully featured CAD application called Rhino3d and walk through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions. This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary-level geometry, and basic computer skills. The session is probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on the child's capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be to create up to two basic things- a cup, and a keychain.\r\nLess confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up with parents or siblings and just watch the parent/sibling. Kids that complete the kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walk-through lab as they will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: We have a fairly large number of printers in the lab so our kids can possibly print items they make in class. If your child completes a model, we will be able to produce a screen render if desired or we will make our best efforts to print at least one model per student, based on demand.",

It covers what the keywords mean and - just as importantly - what they *don't* mean. We'll be covering What You Need To Know, including several different conceptual models of async/await that you can switch between at will. This refresher course will take a look at the common async best practices with a careful examination of why they're best practices and when to ignore the best practices. We'll be including some semi-advanced topics (specifically ValueTasks, asynchronous disposal, and Channels) to round out techniques for modern asynchronous development.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk is geared towards developers who already use async and await, it would also be appropriate for those who do not (yet).

Or it could be something more complicated, like processing incoming files or building reports.  These tasks should not impede the user experience because they can be done in the background.\r\n\r\nBut in modern .NET applications, what's the best way to implement background services?  There isn't necessarily a right or wrong way, but there are ways that are \"easy to write\" and methods that are \"easy to scale.\"  \r\n\r\nThis talk aims to take you on a journey through several processes that allow you to do work in the background.

One metric that typically falls short is code coverage because it can’t measure how WELL our application has been tested, rather, it focuses how MUCH has been tested. What if we ditched this traditional metric and focused on what’s truly valuable instead?\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will employ a testing strategy that provides higher  value than traditional code coverage strategies. This strategy will center around a hyper focus of writing HIGH VALUE tests paired with developing a culture of quality within your organization. As a software or QA engineer, you will walk away  with a greater understanding of when to employ different types of tests (unit, e2e, integration, etc.) so that they are providing high value rather than chasing code coverage. Additionally, you will learn the behaviors and strategies to build a culture of quality to replace the accountability that is traditionally driven by Code Coverage.",

Even if you don't need your own PTZ rig, you'll still learn about some really cool JavaScript APIs like Web Serial, and the Gamepad API that you may not be aware of.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever been in the market for a webcam that supports pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ), you'll know that it's pretty difficult to find one for under $1000. That's just silly, when we have the technology and APIs to build our own for around 100 bucks! ",

                "description": "Software touches every aspect of our lives, and no where is that clearer than in the automotive industry. With the recent surge to AI for self driving cars, we lose sight of adaptive cruise control, anti-lock breaks, and in-cab media centers that all require software to operate.\r\n\r\nHowever, did you realize that software plays a fundamental role in the streets you drive on? This talk is a post-mortem of a prototype system we built for optimizing the use of municipal funds for highway maintenance in the state of Indiana. While the optimizer is a central piece of the system, it wasn’t the whole system, or even the most challenging problem!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll cover:\r\n\r\n* The general problem of highway maintenance\r\n* How users acceptance and understanding may be a more important metric than pure cost optimization\r\n* How to build AI in an agile manner\r\n* How AI was merely a part of a much larger system\r\n* What changes when your software has to change hearts and minds as well as accomplish a technical task?\r\n",

Working hybrid is by far harder than either remote or on-site work because you need to accommodate both and then do something extra to keep everyone in the room and everyone on the call engaged.\r\n\r\nHow do you ensure that teammates can all contribute and there’s nothing left unsaid? What techniques can you use to put everyone on equal footing when your teammates are across an ocean or still finishing Monday’s work when you start your day on Tuesday?\r\n\r\nWorking hybrid is a muscle that needs strengthened in order to unlock inclusion and diversity of thought for all team members no matter their location.

In times like this, it might feel like there’s nothing you can do but hold on for dear life.\r\n\r\nBut there *are* things you can do. You can start to understand what happened to your brain during this time. You can figure out how your brain handles traumatic events like this, learn how to recover as things slowly start to get better, and you can begin to prepare yourself for future crises. Take the time to make your brain your ally, and you won’t be fighting it during the next crisis that comes along.",

                "description": "I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time the past half decade across multiple companies working with very large, long running enterprise systems. Especially in long running, constantly changing systems, you want the code to be easy to understand, relatively painless to extend or modify, and when advantageous, be simple to modernize with updated technology. Unfortunately, the systems I’ve worked on have consistently failed to satisfy these goals.\r\n\r\nIronically enough though, my judgment is that the code in these systems has been hard to understand, extend or change, and modernize because they had all adopted much of the very industry conventional wisdom about how to build large, maintainable systems. \r\n\r\nIn particular, I want to demonstrate and explain how I think that prescriptive, layered architectural styles like Clean or Onion Architecture can actually cause harm in larger systems. I also want us to train our sights on how teams attempt to hide the actual persistence technology with “repository” abstractions and why I also think that’s harmful. I want us to shine a light on how teams fall down a trap of organizing code around business entities or data storage in ways that helps make the code in big systems hard to work with.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, we’re going to talk about alternatives, or at least ways to ameliorate the potential problems with prescriptive architectural approaches. In particular, I’m going to show the shift to vertical slice architecture approaches for organizing code. I’m also going to examine ways to reduce code ceremony to improve code readability and use that to show the negative tradeoffs of using approaches like the Clean Architecture that mandate some elements of code ceremony to “force” developers into a consistent approach. And finally, we’re going to examine whether or not “consistency” should be a first class goal in code organization or architecture.\r\n",

                "description": "Exceptions are powerful and valuable, but we frequently misuse them and destabilize our applications. We fear users seeing an error message, so we swallow the exception, creating troubleshooting nightmares down the road. We fail to check inputs and throw them at all, letting garbage into our databases that ruins our application’s correctness. When we do actually get around to throwing an error, we use unclear messages that mislead and distract or we go overboard and cover our entire codebase with annoying try-catch blocks that make the code impossible to read.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! This talk will tell you about numerous exception-related antipatterns and how to fix them. You’ll get practical examples born of real-world codebases that show you how to design your systems in ways that are easy to troubleshoot. If you’re new to object-oriented programming with exceptions, you’ll get a lot out of this talk: you’ll learn how to do exceptions the right way and enjoy safer and more maintainable code.",

                "description": "\"Oh no! I just typed something into git and now my work is gone! Ahh!\"\r\n\r\nDon't panic. Contrary to popular belief, git is one of the most non-destructive version control systems available. When used right, git\r\nnever loses any data, and even when misused, chances are very high you can still recover.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present turn-by-turn directions on how to recover from a wide array of common git mistakes, and also provide some workflows\r\nto minimize them.\r\n\r\nExamples include, but are not limited to:\r\n* Changing spelling errors in commit messages.\r\n* Split commits into multiple commits with logical separation.\r\n* Combining multiple commits into one.\r\n* Resetting the base commit when you accidentally branch off of the wrong branch.\r\n* Recovering from merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nAs well as more advanced topics, such as:\r\n* Extracting parts (e.g. sub-directory) of a repository as a new repository.\r\n* Merging multiple repositories into one while retaining version history.\r\n* Removing confidential data accidentally committed.",

But these two concepts aren’t mutually exclusive. In fact, the best-performing agile teams keep one eye on their longer-term strategy to ensure it still aligns with what they’re learning from their customers.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn the different lenses through which agile teams view short-term, near-term, and long-term planning and how you can apply these same lenses with your own team. You’ll also learn common frameworks that can be used at each level of planning, as well as what amount of adaptability you can expect at each level. Finally, you’ll learn how each of these different levels of planning work together to create a coherent and cohesive strategy for your team.",

Cross-platform development, extensible code, native UIs and more can be realized when extending the full power of these features with other objects like Docker containers and K8's.

In this presentation, we will unravel the mystery of embeddings, emphasizing their mathematical foundations and practical applications. \r\n\r\nWe'll start by discussing what embeddings are, and what they represent. Then we'll delve into the variety of tools we have to compare and contrast them, including Cosine similarity and distance, as well as clustering. Then we'll put those tools to use creating powerful applications that go beyond just typical chat and analytics use-cases. Because we'll be focusing on operational use-cases, code demos will be done using C# rather than Python.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with a deeper understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of embeddings, practical knowledge of how to use them, and an appreciation for their value in our applications. This session is ideal for developers, data scientists, and anyone interested in the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning and natural language processing.",

                "description": "Design systems are at their core a repository of solved UX interaction design problems made re-usable and highly visible for others to leverage. Accessibility, on the other hand, is an outcome that is usually hard fought for and hard won for any organization - especially at scale. As technologists, it's our responsibility to build applications that allow everyone to participate more actively in society, and design systems provide the perfect architecture to get started on that journey. An accessible design system provides us much more than just a foundation for building with accessible components - it also provides a centralized source of documentation on how to get the larger scale experience design (and accessibility patterns) correct. In this session we'll look at how design systems and their governance structures can be intentionally constructed as a center of excellence and focal point for accessibility maturity for organizations of any scale.",

One of the best strategies for a successful negotiation is to determine what the other side values, and it’s not always the lowest number.  In this talk, we’ll answer the following: \r\n\r\nWhat constraints does an HR department put in place?  \r\nWhat budgetary concerns do managers have to balance? \r\nHow does salary negotiation interact with development plans and job titles?\r\nHow does that change for small companies vs. large enterprises?\r\n\r\nThe answers to all of these will help you craft a better strategy for your next salary negotiation, from when to start it, to how to conduct it, and when to plan the next one.\r\n",

                "description": "You're onboarding a new team member, or your team recently inherited a project that uses a different SDK/framework version than your current project uses. What do you do?  Install the old SDK/framework versions? Can they even be installed at the same time on the same machine?  What if I told you there was a way to accomplish this with little to no effort on your part?  Well, with Visual Studio Code, Docker, and the Dev Containers extension, you can.  Dev containers can help you easily on-board new people to your projects, allow for cleaner machines with greater support for multiple SDKs/Framework, and be able to develop/debug/run your solution from anywhere without Visual Studio Code. Oh, and put an end to \"It works on my machine\"\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll walk through how you can set up a dev container to support your application development, without installing the SDK/framework on your machine. I’ll show you how to get started and how you can solve the age-old problem of “It works on my machine!”.  As a bonus, if your code is hosted on GitHub, I’ll show you how you can run/edit/debug your project right from GitHub.com without Visual Studio Code on your machine.\r\n",

In mathematics, factoring is used to pull out factors of numbers through division, and importantly prime numbers have factors of only themselves and the identity constant, 1.\r\n\r\nSoftware also has factors, and the process of factoring is used to help reduce the scope of complex software to its prime factors, each of which elegantly performs a single function or responsibility.\r\n\r\nLearn how to factor - and refactor - your non-prime code into more elegant, testable, and maintainable prime code.",

                "description": "When you've written your last line of code, what will be your legacy?  Will your applications live on forever in Production or at least until AI takes over?  Will your Github repos be archived and immortalized?  Will there be patterns or tools named after you?  For most of us, there probably won't be great fame or fanfare about our amazing contributions to digital environments.  However, while using software to creatively solve real world problems is exhilarating, creating someone else who can do the same is an even more rewarding experience.  In this session, we will talk about how to pass on our passion for problem solving with code to the next generation.  Whether you are a relative noob with little experience or a seasoned veteran with decades of crusty code under your belt, we will learn the importance and how-to of uplifting the nerds of the future.

Sadly, few developers have ever been taught how to approach debugging - it's something most of us learn through painful experience.  The good news is you _can_ learn how to debug effectively, and there's several key techniques and tools you can use for debugging JS and React apps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll look at:\r\n  \r\n- Core principles and steps for approaching debugging\r\n- How to use both print logging and GUI debugging tools effectively\r\n- Specific tips for debugging JS code\r\n- Approaches and techniques for debugging React components and Redux logic\r\n\r\n## Structure / TOC\r\n\r\n- How to Approach Debugging\r\n  - Why is debugging important?\r\n  - Core principles and mindset\r\n  - Scientific steps for debugging\r\n  - General tips and techniques\r\n- Debugging Tools\r\n  - Print logging vs graphical debuggers\r\n  - Print logging techniques\r\n  - GUI debugger concepts and controls\r\n  - GUI debugger techniques\r\n  - Time-travel debugging with Replay\r\n- Debugging JS\r\n  - Logging methods and console interaction\r\n  - Working with 3rd-party libraries\r\n- Debugging React and Redux\r\n  - Understanding React's component model, data flow, and common mistakes\r\n  - Using the React DevTools\r\n  - Understanding Redux's data flow and common mistakes\r\n  - Using the Redux DevTools",

                "description": "It's 2024 and software engineering teams and security teams are still struggling to figure out how we can all just get along. Engineering teams are commonly frustrated and annoyed at all the extraneous stuff security wants them to do. And security teams are commonly frustrated with the lack of results they see in vulnerability remediation and secure coding efforts. There's got to be a better way to work together. \r\n\r\nCome explore how building relationships between engineering teams and security teams can remove some of the frustration we all feel in the software product development world. We will discuss how culture, empathy, advocacy, communication, leadership and negotiation skills can change things. Security initiatives like a security champions program, a security community of practice, meaningful training, and team collaboration are important on the security side. This session isn't just for managers or security practitioners, it's for everyone who works in IT and deals with security challenges.",

The only problem is that it requires a completely different set of APIs that many developers find counter-intuitive. What if you can achieve the same performance using thread-per-request APIs, and let the Java virtual machine handle the hard work of blocking when appropriate, and executing platform threads when the time is right? Enter virtual threads, a key feature of Project Loom, currently available in JDK 19. In this session, we'll look at how different frameworks, such as Helidon and Quarkus, are using this powerful new feature to increase throughput without requiring reactive programming models.",

We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them. If you have heard of the exciting world of CAD and 3D printing but have never tried it or would like a basic overview, this session is for you!",

We will focus in on the process of using CAD to create our model with a NURBS modeler called Rhino3D and will walk through the UI and how Rhino uses basic curves and shapes to create more advanced geometry and create up to three basic models: a goblet, and a challenge coin\r\n\r\nHigh School aged teens or late junior high aged students may also attend adult sessions. Additionally, kids that complete all kid projects in the morning sessions without issue are welcome in this lab as well as we will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.",

But, often, quality can take a backseat in considerations until products or features near release - which is far too late!  Taking a team-centric approach to quality assurance and control can ease pressures, resource use, and obstructions in later development stages. \r\n\r\nLeveraging her test garden as a tangible metaphor, Emily will explore different technologies, tools, and methodologies that could synchronize your team’s perspective on testing best practices, and help improve your QA processes as a whole.\r\n\r\nJoin this session for inspiration and insights to reframe your approach to whole-team, quality-first development!\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Cultivation of quality takes foresight, execution, and consistent monitoring to fine-tune processes\r\n- There is no singular method for creating quality; your definition should help define your approach\r\n- The importance of the entire team’s buy-in for adoption of YOUR best practices\r\n- The many ways releases and cycles can go awry; tips for prevention",

                "description": "(Presented by Samantha Holstine)\r\nA recent (2022) poll by Kong placed the average number of microservices for a single enterprise at 184! Modern architecture patterns are great at optimizing resource usage, but what happens when you need to make a critical change to one process that spans multiple shared services?\r\n\r\nComplex business processes can be difficult to manage and automate. How do you quickly implement changes while maintaining uptime? How do you introduce a new service to an existing process? In this talk, we will discuss how to use Business Process Modeling (BPM) to orchestrate and execute complex business processes in your application. Don't let the name fool you: this is not your father's Visio diagram. Everyone should leave this talk with a new approach to solving their orchestration complexities!",

What if you could “manage” your boss, to not only your benefit, but to your co-workers benefit as well? \r\n\r\nTake back control and learn to manage up so that you can work with all types of people and succeed no matter the environment. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we cover the common archetypes of “bad leaders”, why they operate this way, and practical methods to work with difficult leaders so that you can keep the work moving and your sanity intact. \r\n\r\nThere’s no miracle cures here, but you’d be surprised on what’s possible. \r\n\r\nTarget Audience: Contributors who deal with frustrating leaders, and for leaders themselves who are willing to be self-reflective. \r\n",

Turns out, spec writers and browser makers both are working hard to find common JS patterns and implementing them in CSS and HTML. Things like accordions, auto-suggest, smooth scrolling, dialogs are all available without JS. Looking a little ahead, things like parallax scrolling, styleable selects and component-dependent styling are expected to make their CSS-debut as well.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I walk through a few common patterns, explain how they can be implemented in CSS and HTML, how that's better and what accessibility implications they have, both for features available today and feature available soon™️.",

                "description": "GraphQL is a declarative query language that simplifies retrieving data from an application's back end. It provides a clear and comprehensive description of the data in your API, giving you the ability to request only what you need. This makes it easy to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will cover the basics of GraphQL and how it differs from traditional RESTful API architectures. You will learn how to construct API requests using the query language on the client side. On the server side, you will learn how to create a schema and data fetchers (controller methods) to power them. We will also discuss best practices for building GraphQL APIs with Spring Boot, including batch loading, pagination, and error handling.\r\nBy the end of this talk you will have everything you need to build your first GraphQL API in Spring.",

Where do you even start with scaling in Azure?\r\n\r\nThis session will cover all there is to know about efficiently scaling an app on Azure; from scaling on App Service, to hosting in containers on AKS, and all the DevOps magic in between.\r\n\r\nLets start by exploring the auto-scaling options available in Azure App Service, using Application Insights to guide the thresholds we set and monitor how our app performs. We'll see the impact that external dependencies (database, storage) has on scaling, and smart ways to mitigate any challenges that arise.\r\n\r\nAs our scale grows, so will our costs... We'll share our tips for cost effective scaling, taking a look at the options Azure makes available at our fingertips – through containerized apps + AKS, and serverless products like Azure SQL Serverless.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll show how to configure a deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps that glues all of these solutions together.",

We have some additional options to expand model building skills for those who have been through our previous sessions. \r\n\r\nThis session the goal will be to build a raceable “matchbox/hot wheels scaled” 3d-printed race car. We will be using a variety of model techniques to produce a model car that resembles a real race car and then print it out on the lab’s advanced resin printers. While this session will repeat, the idea will be that attendees are welcome to come to both race league sessions and make different cars or continue working on tuning the model into a super car! \r\n\r\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D. \r\n \r\nThis session will run Wednesday and Thursday, after the adult session - 4-6pm.\r\n\r\nWe will have some track pieces at the lab to test and possibly race the cars once we get them built!  \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend. \r\n",

To do that, we'll implement an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway, which is a fast, scalable, and open-source API Gateway written in Java, and demonstrate how it can help to level up your software.",

Respectively, these alerts are classified as tickets, email alerts, and pages.\" and I just want to scream. Not because the definition is wrong, but because it's not enough. \r\n\r\nFirst off, if you go from that definition, many devs think (and rightly so) \"Why bother?\". Who wants an unscheduled interruption when there's no intrinsic value. Because, you might notice, the value of the alert is completely missing.\r\n\r\nSecond, and conversely, many practitioner see alerting is seen as the entire reason for monitoring and observability. If you can’t get an alert when something is going wrong, why bother monitoring at all? \r\n\r\nBut those of us who revel in the I.T. sub-discipline of monitoring and observability know that alerts are only one piece of the puzzle. Drawing on decades of experience designing, building, implementing, and supporting solutions from a range of vendors in a variety of  settings, I'll expose the places where alerting often goes wrong, how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to dig yourself out if you're already neck-deep.",

Often times, when we miss the mark, it is due to a communication breakdown between the developer team and the client team on what the actual requirements are.\r\n\r\nCommunication breakdowns generally occur between people with different communication styles. So how do we bridge that gap and get the information we need from people who communicate differently than we do?\r\n\r\nThis talk will be an exploration of communication styles and how we can recognize our own communication style as well as easily determine the communication style of others. With this information we can communicate with someone in the style in which they best receive information. When we communicate with others in their learning style, we break down barriers and are more able to accurately get to the pain points that they need a solution for. Once the communication barriers are down, it becomes easier to get the requirements that we are looking for.",

                "description": "My training as an Osteopathic Physician prepared me to counsel my patients about  injury and disease prevention. However, I did not realize the full impact of spending a majority of my time sitting at a desk would have on my overall movement and flexibility. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will provide background education on the most common injuries software engineers are at risk to develop and how I try to prevent these by implementing a few simple measures daily at work.  \r\n\r\nSome of the measures include proper chair/desk/monitor adjustment, workspace setup, stretching routine that can be easily implemented at your desk and much more.",

                "description": "Anyone who is working with AI or considering doing so should care about security. When considering building an AI-powered system or product, the traditional attack surfaces and mitigations still apply. However, new attack surfaces can be present depending on the specific AI approaches used. In addition, due to the typically higher level of automation in AI systems, they can do more harm if they are compromised.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss how AI has the same attack vectors as traditional software, and what those attacks look like. We’ll also discuss new attacks that are specific to generative AI (e.g. LLMs like ChatGPT), machine learning & computer vision systems, and optimization techniques. For each type of attack, we’ll point out how they can be thwarted, or at least mitigated.\r\n\r\nPrevious experience with AI and security are not required to benefit from the session. Attendees will see tools & techniques to help write more secure software, AI-enabled or not. They will walk away with a better understanding of AI-specific attack vectors and their mitigations. They will be equipped to find security education resources in the future.",

                "description": "As the world embraces AI and adopts machine learning, many companies and moving towards using models like the LLMs. Deployment and monitoring such large models are extremely important. As traditional DevOps Engineers, you might not be exposed to working with machine learning systems. This is where MLOps comes in. MLOps is widely talked about and used to make the practice of deploying, managing, and monitoring ML models in production easier. Monitoring ML training or evaluation jobs is obviously very important however it is more important to monitor once an ML model is deployed.\r\n\r\nThis talk first starts by giving a gentle introduction about how ML deployments should be monitored, briefly talking about edge cases in production, data drift, concept drift, model metrics as well as the standard system and resource metrics. We give the audience an overview of observability and monitoring in the context of MLOps. This monitoring could also provide valuable results in terms of whether a model should be retrained, if more data should be collected, if different kinds of data should be collected, and more.\r\n\r\nWe show how one can handle the very important task of monitoring and performing the aforementioned tasks in the context of MLOps with Prometheus. We also show how one could take their existing deployments and add the power of easy and useful monitoring with Prometheus. We will share how this has been accomplished at scale at our workspace including demos using Seldon, Flyte etc.",

                "description": "It’s 2024. Thankfully, developers have a lot of choice in how to build for mobile form factors. Mobile strategy can often be an afterthought – in reality, it needs to be driven by type of app, audience, platform reach, developer expertise & need for code reuse. \r\n\r\nIs Mobile web still an option? Have PWAs matured enough to prove the web as a distribution medium? What key factors demand native mobile apps for iOS/Android/Windows? Can you target dual screen devices or share code with wearables? Developers also want to leverage preferred technology stacks - .NET or JavaScript. .NET MAUI sounds like the next-generation .NET cross-platform story – is it truly native & does it allow bringing in web technologies? How do NativeScript & React Native fare for JS Native apps? How do Blazor & JS Spa apps play in the mobile space? What could developers achieve with Flutter or Uno Platform or Avalonia? \r\n\r\nThe answer to the correct mobile strategy is – it depends. Developers today can build true modern cross-platform mobile apps from single code base, with easy platform API access & matured tooling everywhere. The choice of technology stack should not matter as much. Design & UX are of utmost importance though. Let’s recap options, glimpse into the future and equip ourselves to build amazing mobile apps.\r\n",

You type arcane incantations using cryptic symbols, crafting messages incomprehensible to most mortals and communicating them to vast, unknowable systems, to be executed blindly by idiot machine gods who follow our instructions to the very character. We're an elite class of human, chosen through intense courses of secluded study, or simply by the winds of chance, to engage with this symbolic and mystic realm. But while we're comparing ourselves to wizards, witches, and sorcerers, we're actually leaving one of their most powerful tools on the table: rituals.\r\n\r\nLet's learn what our brain does when we do an activity repeatedly, with other humans, or simply by ourselves. You'll learn the difference between a ritual and a routine, you'll discover why ritual practices are an important part of being a group, and you'll get an overview of when, where, and how to employ these powerful tools. You'll complete your magical arsenal, and you'll never look at a retrospective the same way again.",

                "description": "When we’re asked when something will be done, it’s tempting to answer the question. “It’ll be done on March 32nd” or “it’ll take 182.5 days” or “we need 15 sprints”. It doesn’t matter if that answer is the best-case, average, or worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe answer is fundamentally wrong because using a single value hides the fact that what we really meant was a distribution of possible dates, durations, or outcomes. The exact value is uncertain. Development may be faster or slower than we thought. What if the tech lead wins the lottery and retires? What if a global pandemic forces us to change the way we work?\r\n\r\nWhile we can’t control any of those factors, we can be mindful of their existence and communicate more clearly. In this talk we will introduce “bet” language, which makes uncertainty and luck an explicit part of the conversation. This mindset helps us accurately assess risks, pick the right risks to embrace, and avoid analysis paralysis. It also helps us learn in an uncertain world, where even if we make good decisions, we may experience bad outcomes (and vice versa!).",

                "description": "Have you ever felt that your humble text editor could be—should be—so much more?  After all, the software we're writing is much more than text!  Programming languages mandate rigid structures for textual code, for instance that (in some languages) the conditional for an \"if\" must be in parentheses, but it seems that our editors are woefully unaware of these rules.  While modern editors can list the methods on an object after you type a period, they don't seem to know that after \"if\" comes \"then\"!  If only we had \"smarter\" editors that could take some of the drudgery out of writing code, we may be able to achieve greater productivity.\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, developers have been thinking about this for quite some time.  In fact, editors that operate on programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs) instead of textual code, known as \"projectional editors,\" have been around since the 1980s!  Unfortunately for us, however, they have always been fairly niche and had several significant drawbacks.  Together we'll explore the complicated history of these editors, the current state-of-the-art, and the prospects for a more efficient future!",

Your quality professionals need your help to help them test better. This talk will provide insight as to what your QA person goes through when deciding what to test, where to test, and how to test any given piece of work. You can use it to do better dev testing on the side before it goes into that Ready For QA column. \r\nThis is an entry-level talk designed for developers and new QAs that introduces some common testing concepts and explains some of the reasoning behind QA methodology. There’s also a short segment on the three basic types of work that development teams tend to get and how to test them. Important questions covered are, in order, why, what, where, and how to test.\r\n",

                "description": "\"When will it be done?\" How often have you been asked that question? That question strikes fear or frustration in most people. It often results in throwing up your hands in frustration or tossing out a wild guess. Surely there's a better way?\r\n\r\nForget story points, t-shirt sizing, historical averages. Have you considered building a simple forecasting model—one that provides a range of possible outcomes with confidence levels?\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer, project manager, or scrum master, it's important we can answer this question confidently in a way that provides clarity and predictability.  We can do that by applying techniques like Monte Carlo simulation and continuous forecasting. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore those practices and discuss how you can leverage them no matter your role.  I'll share a few models and spreadsheets we use with our clients including examples.  We'll walk through how to use these to support better communication and consider what-if scenarios.  You'll leave with a practical set of tools you can start using tomorrow!  \r\n\r\nAnswering the question \"When will it be done?\" will no longer create frustration or fear like it once did.",

                "description": "Cross-functional teams and full-stack developers have become the expectation in today's highest-performing teams. However, as technology needs become more complex and solutions begin to scale, it becomes increasingly difficult for software engineers to balance expertise across all layers of the stack, operations, security, development tools, etc. This leads to an increased cognitive load for your engineers, resulting in lower performance, longer development times, decreased quality, and, ultimately, developer burnout. In this talk, we'll explore how applying Product Thinking to Platform Engineering can reduce this burden on your development teams while preventing organizational bottlenecks. Join this talk to learn what a platform is, what the product mindset is, and how to architect for enterprise flow.",

                "description": "Faking remote services can be very useful. Maybe you need to build against a service that isn't created yet, mock micro service dependencies, test against an API that only has a production instance or validate a large number of data scenarios that would be difficult to achieve with a \"real\" instance.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and more, Mountebank is the best free, cross platform tool for the job. With it, you can spin up your imposter services and have them respond over-the-wire, just like the real thing.\r\nThese imposter endpoints can be instantiated from a configuration file, on the fly based on business logic of an executing test, from any tool that can make a POST or any combination of them.\r\n\r\nIt works by exposing stubs filtered by predicates that dynamically match a request with a response based on properties you define in the URL, headers, body content, etc. It can even be configured to respond in multiple ways per predicate in a round-robin fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd its not just for HTTP. Mountebank supports TCP, SMTP and other community contributed protocols.\r\n\r\nThis session shows you how easy it is to harness the power of Mountebank to create and use imposters. We demonstrate starting the tool, spinning up imposters via code or http tool (like postman), employing security, viewing the logs, capturing and validating responses and tearing down when done.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session you will have the knowledge to begin leveraging imposters in your testing workflow to gain more confidence in your software.",

It's not a new approach, and went by other names in the past (e.g. Onion, Hexagonal, Ports-and-Adapters). One of the main benefits of the approach is its focus on business logic and its reduction in coupling to external infrastructure concerns (databases, web APIs, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn the principles behind Clean Architecture and how to apply it to real world apps built with the latest version of ASP.NET Core. You'll leave with a solution template you can use to get started on new projects with a working Clean Architecture solution in minutes!",

Event-driven architectures have emerged as a powerful paradigm to achieve this goal. In this enlightening talk, we will delve into the world of event-driven user interfaces, exploring how this approach revolutionizes the way we build interactive software.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging event-driven paradigms, developers can create highly modular and loosely coupled systems that are more resilient to change. We will explore event-driven design patterns, such as event sourcing, pub-sub, and reactive programming, that enable seamless communication and collaboration between different components of an application.\r\n\r\nExamples will be in C# using a Blazor Web Application, but the concepts are fundamental and transferrable to many front-end frameworks and languages.",

The more complex the application, the more difficult it can be to track down the root cause of a bug. An exception at the service or database layer may manifest itself as unpredictable behavior at the user interface level. Simple coding errors or unexpected inputs may result in unnecessary and confusing error messages. The net result is an application that doesn't meet the user's expectations. These types of issues can be avoided by handling exceptions properly. In this session, we'll look at examples of what happens when exceptions aren't handled, and how you can avoid unexpected defects by following a few key principles and using some discipline. We'll also examine the importance of establishing logging standards, and look at how to properly configure error pages and use the error handling facilities in back-end Java services and web apps.\r\n\r\n",

Do you think CSS is hard to work with?\r\n\r\nBy getting a better understanding of the concepts that underlie the language, you’ll learn to “see the matrix”. There’s normal flow, stacking context, offset parents… how do they interact with grid and flex layouts? This talk unveils those concepts in a fun and engaging way.",

Sometimes we neglect the emotional side of our hard work, leaving teams brittle and less able to adapt and bend. How do we release tension and form the strong bonds that a good team needs to be successful as well as honing some of our hard won skills?\r\n\r\nAs children, we form strong bonds during recess or at play dates. As adults, we lose this sense of companionship and playfulness. Bring it back to your team with targeted fun activities that create a sense of mindfulness, improve skills, and are just downright enjoyable. Team building is the most difficult aspect of leadership–peer or otherwise. One of the best ways to facilitate team building is play!\r\n\r\nI will present a method for skills and team building outside of the norm in play time. I will show how events can be arranged, when to do them, and what the benefits are for play time–including stronger teams that work better together due to their powerful relationships between team members.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss different games such as TestSphere Arena, TestSphere Bingo, “Murder” Mystery, Quality Jenga, The Planning Game, Telephone, and more!

We will explore messaging design patterns such as competing consumers, pub/sub, event sourcing, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), and more. You will gain an understanding of how these patterns can improve your system design and development. We will explore the benefits of decoupled, event-driven systems and how they contribute to fault tolerance, scalability, and adaptability in complex ecosystems.\r\n\r\nI will demonstrate implementing the messaging and eventing patterns showing you how to put these concepts into practice using platforms like Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, and Event Grid. You'll learn hands-on techniques for building robust, event-driven solutions that can handle the demands of modern, distributed applications.\r\n\r\nLastly, I will guide you through real-world use cases and practical insights, equipping you with the knowledge and tools to harness asynchronous messaging. \r\n\r\nWhether you are an experienced developer looking to expand your skill set or an architect seeking to optimize your system's design, this session promises valuable insights and practical takeaways to help you create resilient, scalable, and responsive systems. messaging and eventing to achieve their goals.",

                "description": "When you think of voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, you probably are thinking of a device on a shelf or a desk somewhere, tethered to a power outlet. But what if you could take Alexa with you wherever you go? \r\n\r\nSeveral devices allow for mobile Alexa, including Echo Auto, Echo Frames, Echo Buds, Fossil Gen 6 watches, and the TalkSocket. You can even take Alexa with you on your phone using the Alexa app or on your Apple Watch using the Voice in a Can app. Being able to take Alexa with you opens a whole new world of possibilities, enabling voice application developers to create voice experiences that help users no matter where they are.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll see how to create Alexa applications (called \"skills\") that can take advantage of Alexa while on-the-go. You'll learn how to gain permission to access the user's location and provide information relevant to that location. We'll also have a look at a real-world Alexa Skill that uses location awareness to enhance a visit to Disneyland or Disney World theme parks.",

                "description": "This second session is a follow up where we get to make 3D models! Children must have a responsible adult present. We will work with a fully featured CAD application called Rhino3d and walk through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions. This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary-level geometry, and basic computer skills. The session is probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on the child's capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be to create up to two basic things- a cup, and a keychain.\r\nLess confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up with parents or siblings and just watch the parent/sibling. Kids that complete the kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walk-through lab as they will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: We have a fairly large number of printers in the lab so our kids can possibly print items they make in class. If your child completes a model, we will be able to produce a screen render if desired or we will make our best efforts to print at least one model per student, based on demand.",

But how do you go about building one from scratch? Taking a transactional, goal-oriented approach may be good engineering design, but it tends to fall apart when your network is made of humans with squishy feelings. \r\nIn this session, you'll learn how to engage with people, even when it's scary. You'll discover the value of community beyond short-term results. You'll get advice on altruistic participation, and see why that works in the long run. And you'll find out how to ask for help appropriately when you need it.\r\nAttendees will learn:\r\n* What a network is for, and what it isn't for\r\n* How to break the transactional mindset around networking\r\n* How to make new connections for yourself and others\r\n* How to contribute to a community before asking favors of it\r\n* How to engage your network when you need help",

                "description": "As web developers, we’ve been building web applications the same way for 25 years. We send a request, and we receive a response. We might get a whole page back, or we might get some data to render, but the common thread for almost every web application that has ever been built is the request/response cycle. What if we didn’t have to do it this way? What kind possibilities would open up to us?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a simple, existing design pattern that you are probably already familiar with even if you don’t know it by name: the Event/State Reducer pattern. You’ve already used it if you’ve worked with Redux or Elm. We are going to stretch this pattern just a little: we will publish events from the client, use reducer functions on the server to compute our new state, and subscribe to these state changes on the client.\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore this idea with several code examples that gradually increase in complexity. We’ll see how building collaborative and real-time applications becomes natural and straightforward. We’ll also see how to combine statically generated websites with interactive applications in a way that was difficult or impossible before. You can expect to come away with practical but hopefully mind expanding new approaches to building your next application. \r\n",

This is how to build them.\r\n\r\nTired of reading articles about async that just don't go deep enough? Here you go. This is the async masterclass. There are no breakfast food analogies here. Except bacon, because bacon is awesome. Bacon.\r\n\r\nForget Task. We'll be learning ValueTask. And IAsyncDisposable. And AsyncLocal < T > . Oh, and asynchronous queues - time to learn some Channels. Let's throw in asynchronous synchronization primitives. And I mean building those - seeing how they actually work - not just using them. This ain't your momma's SemaphoreSlim; it's time to build your *own* asynchronous \"pause\" primitive with TaskCompletionSource < T > . Speaking of TCS, we'll also cover the dictionary completion technique. Let's build our own AsyncLazy < T > , too. Maybe we'll even tackle asynchronous caching and the challenges that come with that (spoiler: we will).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a random assortment of topics, but each of these skills are valuable as soon as you move from basic async/await into real-world complexity. By the end of this masterclass, you'll be equipped to take your async to the next level!\r\n\r\nMmm... bacon...",

Between Scouting, advising friends, KidzMash, and my own Thing 1 and Thing 2, I have accumulated a rather dramatic list of ideas that do and do not work.  Programming, social networking, getting through COVID, gaming, hacking, and surviving the world today have all been implemented and tested. When I start the talk, you'll likely have a few questions about my sanity. When I have completed the talk, you will have a toolbox of new things to try - and maybe even a new attitude about kids and tech. I look forward to your joining me, and perhaps my Things, on a retrospective of our wild adventure.  I mean after an eighteen year sprint, I think it is time for a retrospective, don't you?",

Are you intimidated by the potential complexity of that kind of approach? \r\n\r\nFear not, using a combination of the Postgresql-backed Marten (https://martendb.io) library for event sourcing and its newer friend Wolverine (https://wolverine.netlify.app) for command handling and asynchronous messaging, I'll show you how you can quickly get started with both CQRS and Event Sourcing. Once we get past the quick start, I'll show you how the Critter Stack's unique approach to the \"Decider\" pattern will help you create robust command handlers with very little code ceremony while still enjoying easy testability.\r\n\r\nMoving beyond basic command handling, I'll show you how to reliably subscribe to and publish the events or other messages created by your command handlers through Wolverine's durable outbox and direct subscriptions to Marten's event storage.",

                "description": "The first iteration of a product never succeeds. Nor does the second, the tenth, or even the 20th. Instead, most of the successful products we know and love today were abject failures at the start…but then evolved to get better.\r\n\r\nChances are your own product might be heading toward failure right now. And while you might be experiencing some of the same failure patterns as early versions of Netflix, YouTube, and Post-Its, you may not have the luxury of a big budget or long runway to pull your product back from the brink.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there are cheap and easy-to-implement techniques that you can start using immediately that can help you iterate quickly enough to find your product’s path to success before it’s too late. In this session, you’ll learn how to use techniques from Lean Customer Development and Lean Startup to quickly guide your product through multiple iterations toward finding product-market fit. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you’ll have everything you need to set up a Lean Customer Development framework in your own company without having to ask for additional budget or resources. And you’ll finally be ready to lead your product out of the pits of failure and into the daybreak of success.",

                "description": "So many software development teams rack up technical debt and do not even realize it.  But even if you are a more mature team and recognize and maybe even document technical debt, what good is it if you do not take action.  Just like in other parts of our life, just because we can accumulate bunches of debt, if we do not take steps to handle it, we will be destined for bad times when that comes due.  In this session, we’ll explore technical debt, how to properly document and track it, and – more importantly – how to address it so that it does not cause significant issues down the road.",

We'll progress to look at accessing secrets as part of a CI/CD pipeline, or loading them into infrastructure at runtime, to eliminate hard-coded secrets from every aspect of our projects.\r\n\r\nWhat about when things inevitably go slightly wrong...?\r\n\r\nWe will follow the stories of a few real world breaches: what went wrong, how we responded, the lessons we learnt, and how that feeds back into our processes.\r\n\r\nI will discuss the processes we have implemented with our clients to manage secrets on a large scale – including following a least trust approach, methods for revoking and cycling credentials, and appropriately mapping our dependencies so we can measure the impact of a change.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will look at the ways automation can help, including configuring automatic secret detection tools (GitHub and Azure DevOps) and CodeQL checks in our pipelines.",

Are you currently using AWS and need help understanding the .NET landscape?  Are you comparing cloud providers and looking to understand what AWS can offer? Whether it’s an older .NET Framework 3.5 web app or the newest .NET 8 microservice, AWS has a service that can run it.\r\n\r\nYou'll see demonstrations such as:\r\n\r\n* .NET apps running in EC2 virtual machines\r\n* ElasticBeanstalk hosting an IIS website\r\n* Lambda functions written in C#\r\n* .NET container workloads in Elastic Container Service\r\n\r\nYou'll even see how to use C# to provision the necessary infrastructure! You'll leave this session ready to run your .NET code in AWS first thing on Monday.",

In this entertaining session, we’ll turn the traditional hiring process on its head and share a new perspective on how to identify the right people for YOUR organization.  You’ll also learn important lessons on what really matters to your employees (spoiler – it’s probably not what you think) and how to keep people engaged for the long term.  Hiring managers are encouraged to attend, but anyone who works on a team will find practical tips on how to work successfully with other human beings.  Whether you work on a remote team or are trying to fill up empty desks in your office, you CAN create your own dream team! ",

Third-party libraries offer so much functionality that they are essential to most teams success. So, how do you make your own library? How do you go from your teams \"utils\" folder, to a package on npm that can be installed across your organization? In this talk, we will look at how to publish a library, set it up to follow best practices, and ensure you maintain code quality. \r\n",

The idea behind this is to have this be a standalone class, but also a fallback for \"the rule of feet\".\r\n\r\nWant to get started in electronics but don’t know where to get started? You’ll be shocked how easy it is! Get hands on experience building a few simple circuits and start yer Maker’in!\r\n\r\nKids 10+ welcome with adult supervision. The advanced section will cover using Arduino microcontrollers so install Pre-requisites on your laptop for the last section.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites: Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)\r\n\r\nAdditional notes\r\nKit required. Please see eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codemash-2023-tickets-396878312717) for tickets. Limited \"free\" kits are available but free kits must be returned before leaving the Makerspace.\r\n\r\nSlidedeck: https://tinyurl.com/3xmw9jmh",

During this session, kids will use their creativity and problem-solving skills to build structures to see how severe of an earthquake they can withstand on a shake-table.  Kids will investigate and discuss what designs survived the shake-table the longest and why.  Then they will revise their designs with the goal of building more resilient structures.  Will you engineer the best structure to withstand an earthquake?",

The idea behind this is to have this be a standalone class, but also a fallback for \"the rule of feet\".\r\n\r\nWant to get started in electronics but don’t know where to get started? You’ll be shocked how easy it is! Get hands on experience building a few simple circuits and start yer Maker’in!\r\n\r\nKids 10+ welcome with adult supervision. The advanced section will cover using Arduino microcontrollers so install Pre-requisites on your laptop for the last section.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites: Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)\r\n\r\nAdditional notes\r\nKit required. Please see eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codemash-2023-tickets-396878312717) for tickets. Limited \"free\" kits are available but free kits must be returned before leaving the Makerspace.\r\n\r\nSlidedeck: https://tinyurl.com/3xmw9jmh",

At the same time, it also comes with a lot of potential pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid. In this talk we'll learn how to apply Domain Driven Design concepts to the front-end of an application as well as several techniques for splitting up a monolithic web application into smaller independently deployable parts. From composition, caching, routing, state management, authentication & communication patterns all the way to test automation strategy, we'll go over some practical approaches and some \"gotchas\" to avoid if you are considering micro-frontend architecture for your organization.",

                "description": "Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the dataset is small. Few-shot learning (FSL) was proposed to tackle this problem. FSL enables making predictions using a limited number of examples with supervised information—that is, with few training samples. It is used across different fields from computer vision to NLP and beyond. Metalearning has been the most common framework for FSL in recent years. The goal of this framework is not to let the model recognize the images in the training set and then generalize to the test set; instead, the goal is to “learn to learn.” Another area where FSL is used is Prompt-Based Learning.\r\n\r\nIn this talk atendees will learn the fundamentals of FSL, including popular networks and loss functions used with the network and the application of FSL techniques in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Computer Vision. I’ll go through the code implementation of Siamese neural networks with pairwise loss on text data to perform topic classification. Atendees will also get familiarity with multi-modal FSL. Further, they will get deeper insight into prompt-based learning paradigm in the context of Large Language Models and OpenPrompt framework. At the end of the talk, atendees will have a good idea of few-shot learning techniques and their applications and will gain a better understanding of deep learning overall.",

Am I going to lose my job?\" and you might have answered, \"I don't know, self.  I haven't even really played with any AI code generation tools.  There are so many tools, I wouldn't even know where to start.\"\r\n\r\nOr maybe you've said, \"Yeah, these code gen tools seem exciting in a glossy corporate demo, but have you tried using a chat interface to _actually_ develop software?  It's a nightmare!\"\r\n\r\nIf those sound like you, then you should come to this talk!  We've rolled out AI tools for all engineers at our company, and we've refined usage to get the most out of them.  I'll demo several recommended AI tool workflows, deliver tips on effectively using these tools, and discuss how you can get started with HUGE productivity gains as a software engineer!  (And maybe - expand your impact and roll the tools out more broadly at your company!)\r\n\r\nIt's the age of the machine!  Take advantage of it!",

                "description": "With a little wiring and a few lines of code, one can create your own hyper-local air sensor system to send alerts, activate smart-windows, and gather data. A sensor measures air particulate density and sends the values to a Raspberry Pi compute unit. The Raspberry Pi then sends the data along with a timestamp and location information to a cloud instance of Redis, a NoSQL data store. Once in Redis, the data can trigger SMS notifications, feed data visualization libraries, or activate electronics such as air purifiers or motors to open or close windows. This can be scaled to monitor air quality in multiple rooms, offices, city blocks, or cities.\r\n\r\n",

The primary purpose of a software rewrite is to ensure functional compatibility before retiring the current system. However, replacing large, complex, bread-and-butter legacy systems is a risky and costly project endeavor, frequently resulting in projects failing, being shelved, or abandoned.\r\n\r\nSoftware rewrites face significant challenges due to many reasons. Testing in this context should account for these challenges. In this session, I'll share strategies that worked for me and my experiences. Learn tips on minimizing architectural transformation for effective delivery/scoping, auditing test data for internal systems, using legacy systems as test oracles, and building effective automation for testing.\r\n\r\nJoin me in my story of a real-life successful software rewrite, packed with valuable nuggets of info. that someday you might find useful.

                "description": "Many people have been using their data lake as vast reservoirs of data. Yet, there’s been a real struggle to harness the full potential of this data to power actionable insights. These data lakes often become stagnant because processing and analyzing them is hard. Hudi’s magic, however, brings a transformative approach to these challenges. Apache Hudi introduces features and services for upserts, incremental processing, and near real-time access. With its unique capabilities, Hudi breathes life into static data lakes, turning them into responsive, efficient, and dynamic systems. By embracing Hudi, organizations can ensure that their data is not just stored but is consistently ready for agile analytics, leading to informed decision-making and unlocking the dormant potential within their vast data repositories.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, attendees will learn:\r\n- The challenges with data lakes\r\n- How Hudi unlocks analytics on the data lake\r\n- Build efficient data pipelines with Hudi’s incremental processing on the data lake \r\n- Demo on how to get started \r\n",
