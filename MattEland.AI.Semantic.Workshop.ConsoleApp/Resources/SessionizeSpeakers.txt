Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!\r\n\r\nI’m a Software Architect, Advocate, Engineer, and Leader who has been working in the field for more years than I like to count (including over twenty-seven years of experience in the software industry). I’m experienced in both the technical and non-technical aspects of software development, I’ve led numerous successful software projects, focusing primarily in state and county agencies, human services, supporting health, education, and disabled communities.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I have discovered that I am as much a people person as I am a technical person. I’m adept at bridging the gap between technology and business leadership, building consensus through communication and shared understanding. I have strong leadership skills with experience in planning and guiding teams through the development cycle, mentoring and training junior developers, interviewing and placing developers, writing and presenting proposals and maintaining vendor partnerships. I’m also a seasoned public speaker having presented at several conferences such as CodeMash, StirTrek, Columbus Women in Tek, and Dogfood conferences.\r\n\r\nI started working with Microsoft technologies in the 90’s and have continuously changed and evolved with the times extending also into open source technologies as well. As such, I’m well-skilled in both Microsoft and open source technologies including cloud technologies in both Amazon Web Services as well as Microsoft Azure. With a strong focus on process and Agile methodologies, I have proven experience in helping teams successfully transform their development practices to leverage modern ALM and DevOps tools and techniques. Recently I've focussed on sharing this experience in the form of technical agile coaching - loving the opportunity to help technical teams do what they do best, only better.\r\n\r\nIn the rare event of free time you can usually find me with my amazing non-binary kid, making music, or spending time with friends and family. I'm a proud and open member of the transgender community and a supporter for social justice for all. ",

He's the top async/await answerer on Stack Overflow, he's assisted hundreds of companies with async adoption across all kinds of applications, his blog has been the go-to source for async advice for years, he contributed some of the MS documentation on subjects such as ValueTask, and he's the maintainer of AsyncEx, a library with >25M downloads which provides asynchronous coordination primitives and other async helper types.\r\n\r\nHe published a .NET-oriented version of the classic TCP/IP FAQ on his blog almost 15 years ago, and has helped countless developers debug their application protocols. At his first job ever, he ended up fixing the primary protocol used in all their systems as well as implementing a TCP/IP replacement for an old serial protocol, and at another job he designed and implemented a multiplexed streaming protocol for embedded devices from scratch. More recently, he recorded a YouTube series where he live-coded a fully asynchronous chat-like TCP/IP protocol using modern .NET pipelines and channels.",
